# Scrapy

Scrapy is a small project developped in rust aiming to scrap Okkazeo,
a french 2nd hand boardgame selling website and compare its price to 
the new version from different stores in order to see if it's a good
deal or not.

That project is kind of a POC for now and has mainly been developped
on a laptop, in a hotel room, at late night, after few beers.
